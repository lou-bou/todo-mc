Project details:

Tech stack:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS

Project: a task manager where users can organize, track, and manage their tasks efficiently.

Core Functionality:
- Create tasks with titles and optional categories
- Edit tasks (edit title and categories)
- Delete tasks
- Mark task as completed (a task has a status property)
- Save data in localStorage

Additional features (ordered):
- Filter tasks by status (all, completed, pending)
- Filter tasks by categories
- Reorder tasks via drag-and-drop
- Search for tasks by keywords (filter by keywords)
- Dark/light mode switch

DOM (UI):
Create task -> 'Add Task' button on top
Edit task -> Pen icon inside a task's div/frame 
Delete task -> Trashbin icon inside a task's div/frame 
Mark as complete -> checkbox next to a task (leftmost)
Filter tasks by category -> dropdown menu with checkboxes for each category
Filter tasks by status -> dropdown menu with checkboxes for each status

Constraints:
- Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS
- Responsive for both mobile and desktop
- Clean UI/UX (animations, icons, clear buttons...etc)
- Storage is done in localStorage

===================================

A task:
Class with title and categories

Creating a task means instantiating an object from its class
Storing it in localStorage means add that object to localStorage

A bunch of tasks:
Organized in a data structure, but in this project, the data structure is localStorage

Can a task "create" itself? Yes, that's the class constructor
But the storing is done by the localStorage API

Can a task "edit" itself? Yes, by using a method similar to the constructor
Storing the edits requires taking out the object stored in localStorage, calling the method to edit, and then adding it to localStorage again

To get a specific task object, we need an ID, so we need to add an ID property to the task class.

Also, when an object is stored in localStorage, its methods should be saved too, because if the object is turned into json data I think its methods are lost (because JSON cannot save methods). The solution would probably be to not add an "edit" method to the todo class, im not sure, ill explore and test when i get to this functionality.

Can a task "delete" itself? no not really, it's the localStorage API that deletes it, simply by removing it from the localStorage data structure.

What does it mean to "mark a task as completed"? on DOM, it means changing the way it looks (putting a line over the task title, greying it out...etc).
But in logic, it's changing the task's status from "pending" to "completed".
To do this, a todo must also have an attribute "status".

So in total, a todo class has:
- id (randomly generated with cryptUUID)
- title
- categories (a list)
- status

Now one last thing, for categories, what should they be? For the sake of simplicity and not overbloating this project, i'll make them predefined.
There are a few categories: Personal - Work - School - Urgent - Short - Long
You can choose one of these 3 projects only. On CLI, you do so by typing the category label (if its wrong itll throw an error and ask for new input), in DOM, there's no room for error as there'll be checkboxes for you to choose from.
If you choose a category, it'll be added to the categories attribute (list).

When would the categories attribute change? In creation and in editing
In creation, whatever the list of chosen categories = the categories attribute
In editing, whatever the list of chosen or unchosen categories 
            -> the categories list is modified (remove from list and add to list)

We could also explicitly make the attribute a list, then in both cases just add/remove from the list

In the beginning I'll make these functionalities only in the CLI, then create their DOM.

Then do the same for additional functionalities.

==================

Create a task functionality:
- Task class with attributes and constructor
- Instantiate the class
- If all works, git commit (without instance)
- Add the object to localStorage
- Retrieve object from localstorage and test method
- Organize functions in the structures
- If all works, git commit
- Create categories to choose from (constraint so other categories cant be made)
- Create functionality for user to add the task by themself through CLI
- Create the last thing but in DOM

persistence:
1) setItem with stringify

retrieval:
1) getItem with parse
2) create new task object (has methods but no attributes) and assign it retrieved object's attributes
